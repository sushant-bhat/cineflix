UPLOADING VIDEO
1. SAVING VIDEO METADATA INTO A DB (SQL OR NO-SQL)
=> Normalization of video metadata
=> Lazy vs Eager loading of array type fields
=> Limitations of Hibernate - The infamous MultipleBagFetchException and N+1 problem

2. VIDEO TRANSCODING
=> Video formats/containers - Package of different streams (video stream, audio stream, subtitles stream) of a video, Ex - mp4, avi etc
=> Encoding - Compressing video files
=> Decoding - Decompressing compressed video files
=> Demuxing - Separating out the streams of a video container
=> Muxing - Combining the streams of a video into a container
=> Video filtering of scaling the input video to different resolutions using different bitrates
=> The different resolutions videos can also be chunked into segments right at the start while scaling and stored
=> There's a master file that maps the segment data according to the resolutions
    =>
=> HLS and DASH are two popular formats for segmenting and creating master file
=> Third party software like FFMPEG can be used that does all the above

STREAMING VIDEO
=> Chunking a video resource using input stream if there's a single video resource to be streamed
=> Browsers automatically support chunked video requests in video player sending range header to BE
=> We can also serve the aformentioned video segments with adaptive streaming
=> Video players also support master file request and subsequent segment file requests in FE
